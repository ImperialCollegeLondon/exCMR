# Reference ranges for exercise cardiac magnetic resonance in adults

Real time (RT) exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (exCMR) is an emerging approach for cardiac
 stress testing as part of a comprehensive cardiovascular imaging assessment. It has advantages over alternative
 approaches due to its high spatial resolution and use of non-pharmacological stress. As access to exCMR increases there
 is a need to establish reference ranges in healthy adults for clinical interpretation.
